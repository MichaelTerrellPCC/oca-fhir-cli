    "note": "Per the recommended DICOM mapping, this element is derived from the Study Description attribute (0008,1030). Observations or findings about the imaging study should be recorded in another resource, e.g. Observation, and not in this element.",
    "modality": "A list of all the series.modality values that are actual acquisition modalities, i.e. those in the DICOM Context Group 29 (value set OID 1.2.840.10008.6.1.19).",
    "procedureCode": "The code for the performed procedure type.",
    "subject": "The subject, typically a patient, of the imaging study.",
    "description": "The Imaging Manager description of the study. Institution-generated description or classification of the Study (component) performed.",
    "reasonReference": "Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this Study.",
    "series.instance.uid": "The DICOM SOP Instance UID for this image or other DICOM content.",
    "series.instance": "A single SOP instance within the series, e.g. an image, or presentation state.",
    "endpoint": "The network service providing access (e.g., query, view, or retrieval) for the study. See implementation notes for information about using DICOM endpoints. A study-level endpoint applies to each series in the study, unless overridden by a series-level endpoint with the same Endpoint.connectionType.",
    "numberOfInstances": "Number of SOP Instances in Study. This value given may be larger than the number of instance elements this resource contains due to resource availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present if any instance elements are present.",
    "series.numberOfInstances": "Number of SOP Instances in the Study. The value given may be larger than the number of instance elements this resource contains due to resource availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present if any instance elements are present.",
    "series.modality": "The modality of this series sequence.",
    "series.laterality": "The laterality of the (possibly paired) anatomic structures examined. E.g., the left knee, both lungs, or unpaired abdomen. If present, shall be consistent with any laterality information indicated in ImagingStudy.series.bodySite.",
    "series.instance.number": "The number of instance in the series.",
    "reasonCode": "Description of clinical condition indicating why the ImagingStudy was requested.",
    "series.performer": "Indicates who or what performed the series and how they were involved.",
    "series.performer.function": "Distinguishes the type of involvement of the performer in the series.",
    "basedOn": "A list of the diagnostic requests that resulted in this imaging study being performed.",
    "series.started": "The date and time the series was started.",
    "identifier": "Identifiers for the ImagingStudy such as DICOM Study Instance UID, and Accession Number.",
    "numberOfSeries": "Number of Series in the Study. This value given may be larger than the number of series elements this Resource contains due to resource availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present if any series elements are present.",
    "series.bodySite": "The anatomic structures examined. See DICOM Part 16 Annex L (http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_L.html) for DICOM to SNOMED-CT mappings. The bodySite may indicate the laterality of body part imaged; if so, it shall be consistent with any content of ImagingStudy.series.laterality.",
    "series.number": "The numeric identifier of this series in the study.",
    "interpreter": "Who read the study and interpreted the images or other content.",
    "series.performer.actor": "Indicates who or what performed the series.",
    "started": "Date and time the study started.",
    "encounter": "The healthcare event (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction) during which this ImagingStudy is made.",
    "series.uid": "The DICOM Series Instance UID for the series.",
    "referrer": "The requesting/referring physician.",
    "series.specimen": "The specimen imaged, e.g., for whole slide imaging of a biopsy.",
    "series": "Each study has one or more series of images or other content.",
    "procedureReference": "The procedure which this ImagingStudy was part of.",
    "series.instance.sopClass": "DICOM instance  type.",
    "location": "The principal physical location where the ImagingStudy was performed.",
    "series.description": "A description of the series.",
    "series.endpoint": "The network service providing access (e.g., query, view, or retrieval) for this series. See implementation notes for information about using DICOM endpoints. A series-level endpoint, if present, has precedence over a study-level endpoint with the same Endpoint.connectionType.",
    "series.instance.title": "The description of the instance.",
    "status": "The current state of the ImagingStudy."
