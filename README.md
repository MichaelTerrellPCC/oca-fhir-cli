# oca-fhir-cli -> open-fhirpak
CLI tool to convert FHIR R4 CVC Immunization bundle in to OCA Schema base and core overlays (Character, Entry, Format and Information overlays). These OCA artifacts can be used 
to create appropriate web forms (for data capture), sub-set schemas can be used to create VC's (verifiable credentials) for decentralized data sharing (in this case Immunization passport).
